The provided Python function `director_to_titles` is intended to create a dictionary where each key is a movie director's name and the corresponding value is a list of movie titles directed by that director. However, there seems to be a mistake in the code. The variable `movies` is being reused in nested scopes, which can lead to confusion and incorrect results. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the code is intended to do, assuming the input `movies` is a list of movie objects, where each movie object has properties `director` and `title`:

1. `{movies.director for movies in movies}`: This is a set comprehension that creates a set of unique director names from the list of movies.

2. `for movies in {movies.director for movies in movies}`: This is a loop that iterates over each unique director name.

3. `[movies.title for movies in movies if movies.director == movies.director]`: This is a list comprehension that is intended to create a list of titles of movies directed by the current director. However, due to the reuse of the variable `movies`, it's comparing the director of a movie to itself, which will always be true, and hence, it will return the titles of all movies.

4. `movies.director: [movies.title for movies in movies if movies.director == movies.director]`: This is a key-value pair in the resulting dictionary. The key is the director's name, and the value is the list of movie titles.

The corrected code should look like this:

```python
def director_to_titles(movies):
    return {
        director: [movie.title for movie in movies if movie.director == director]
        for director in {movie.director for movie in movies}
    }
```

In this corrected version, we use `director` to iterate over the set of unique director names, and `movie` to iterate over the list of movies. This way, the inner list comprehension correctly filters movies by the current director.
